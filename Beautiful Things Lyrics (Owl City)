Sparks soaring down through the pouring rain
and restoring life to the lighthouse.
A slow motion wave on the ocean
stirs my emotion like a rain cloud.

When did the sky turn black?
And when will the light come back?

A cab driver turned to sky diver then to survivor
die in the breakdown.
A blood brother surrogate mother hugging each other
crying their eyes out.

When did the sky turn black?
And when will the light come back?
I'm ecstatic like a drug addict,
launched in the attic strong out of a spellbound.

I fought all through the night,
Oh oh but I made it alive. 
The sun's starting to rise,
Oh oh these are beautiful times.

This fight of my life is so hard, so hard, so hard,
But I'm gonna survive.
Oh oh these are beautiful times.

A bad feeling burned through the ceiling
leaving my healing heart with a new scar.
A dead fire rose and rose higher
like a vampire up from the graveyard.

When did the sky turn black?
And when will the light come back?
We all suffer but we recover just to discover
life where we all are.

I fought all through the night,
Oh oh but I made it alive. 
The sun's starting to rise,
Oh oh these are beautiful times.

This fight of my life is so hard, so hard, so hard,
But I'm gonna survive.
Oh oh these are beautiful times.

This fight of my life is so hard, so hard, so hard,
But I'm gonna survive.
Oh oh these are beautiful times.

My heart's burning bad and it's turning black
but I'm learning how to be stronger.
And sincerely I love you dearly
Oh but I'm clearly destined to wonder.
